This is my first small project using C#(winform). My topic is about library management(in a school), it includes manage book, author, class, faculty, student, teacher(librariant). It can do some basic actions such as manage borrowing books, returning borrowed books and adding more books. 
IF YOU WANT IT WORKS CORRECTLY, PLEASE RUN "LibraryMng_database.sql" FIRST IN SQL SERVER.
Thank you for giving interested in my project. If you have any comments, please feel free to contact me by "trungkien302004@gmail.com".
